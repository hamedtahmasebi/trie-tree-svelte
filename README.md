# Simple Trie tree with a UI

This is a  trie tree (also called prefix tree/digital tree) with a simple UI

Insert a bunch of words, and then when you type you can see suggestions based on the prefix you've entered so far.

This is just a simple-stupid project to practice a little bit of trees and a bit of recursion. and also the best UI framework ever written, sveltekit. and nothing more.
